# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I made a regex pattern to solve the leetcode problem in a different way. I also wanted to use the transpose method for a while now, and I was happy I could try it out in a problem as well!

**Thoughts:** I decided to dedicate this challenge to solve random problems in various websites (Hackerrank, Exercism, Leetcode etc.) I will upload the problems and my solutions to the code directory.

### Day 2: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Used format/sprintf, experiments with round and float numbers. Testing time to figure out which method is faster for a certain task.

**Thoughts:** I spent a bit of time figuring out how to magically add 0's to the end of a float.

5. [HR Time conversion](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Hackerrank/Problem_solving/time_conversion.rb)


### Day 3: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved a medium hard problem (about matrices) during a pair programming session.

**Thoughts:** If you don't see the solution in front of your eyes, try to understand the problem better.

**Links to work:** 
1. [HR Magic square](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Hackerrank/Problem_solving/magic_square.rb)


### Day 4: September 24, 2018

### Day 5: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Hash keys, group_by.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have that much time today.

**Links to work:** 
1. [HR Sock Merchant](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Hackerrank/Problem_solving/sock_merchant.rb)
2. [HR Drawing_book](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Hackerrank/Problem_solving/drawing_book.rb)


### Day 6: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Rotate, [[]].

**Thoughts:** I worked on school projects, and solved a few problems.

**Links to work:** 
1. [HR Circular Array Rotation](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Hackerrank/Problem_solving/circular_array_rotation.rb)
2. [HR permutation equation](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Hackerrank/Problem_solving/permutation_equation.rb)


### Day 7: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: permutation, prime_division.

**Thoughts:** I started solving two problems today, one of them is a tricky one and I still have to work on it.


### Day 8: September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Palindromic numbers, balanced parentheses (Codewars).

**Thoughts:** My codes are working (yay!), but they are not passing the tests for big inputs because of the time / memory constrains. I did some research / playing around about how to figure it out the byte size of an object in Ruby (or around so). I was particularly interested in integers, strings, booleans and arrays. I will try to optimise my code according to this tomorrow.

**Links to work:** 
1. [CW All Balanced Parenthesis](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Codewars/all_balanced_parth.rb)
2. [CW Numeric palindrome](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Codewars/largest_pali.rb)

### Day 9: September 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: BitArray class, bitwise operators.

**Thoughts:** I was playing around with bytes and bits a bit(hehe) more. I learnt about bitwise operators and I tried to implement my version of the BitArray class in Ruby. It's an implementation that is much smaller in size than an eqvialent of an original boolean array, but it's costly in execution time due to the operations with large numbers.

1. [BitArray class](https://github.com/rekapap/Problem-solving/blob/master/Codewars/bit_array.rb)

### Day 10: September 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Recursive functions, backtracking.

**Thoughts:** I did a binary search function to understand better recursive functions. And try to help me solve a backtracking problem.
