# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 21, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I made a regex pattern to solve the leetcode problem in a different way. I also wanted to use the tranpose method for a while now, and I was happy I could try it out in a problem as well!

**Thoughts:** I decided to dedicate this challenge to solve random problems in various websites (Hackerrank, Exercism, Leetcode etc.) I will upload the problems and my solutions to the code directory.

**Links to work:** 
1. [HR Simple arrays of sum](/code/Hackerrank/simple_arrays_of_sum.rb)
2. [Leetcode 771](/code/Leetcode/771.rb)
3. [HR Compare Triplets](/code/Hackerrank/compare_triplets.rb)
4. [HR Very Big sum](/code/Hackerrank/very_big_sum.rb)
5. [HR Diagonal difference](/code/Hackerrank/diagonal_difference.rb)
